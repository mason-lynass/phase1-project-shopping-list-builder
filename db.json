      "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 250°F (120°C) and line a baking tray. In a large bowl, mix together the oats, almonds, seeds, and coconut. Pour the maple syrup, coconut oil, and salt over the oat mixture and toss it to coat. Transfer to the baking tray and bake on the centre rack of the oven for 60 - 70 minutes*, or until lightly golden. Stir every 15 - 20 minutes. When removed from the oven, let cool completely. It will continue to harden as it cools. If adding any dried fruits, stir it in now, then transfer the granola to an airtight container or large glass storage jar. Enjoy!",

Use a knife to slice off the bottom 1/2-inch (or more, if you’d like) of the artichoke stems, and the top 1 inch of the artichoke globes (the leaves on top).  Remove and discard any small leaves toward the bottoms of the stems.  Rinse the artichokes with water.\n3. Slice the artichokes in half vertically.  Use a spoon to scoop out the fuzzy “choke” in the middle of the artichoke.  Then use kitchen shears to trim about 1/4/-inch off the pointy tips of each of the artichoke leaves (so that they don’t poke you when you eat them).  Rub a lemon wedge all over the entire surface of each artichoke half, to prevent browning.\n4.Place the artichoke halves in a baking dish or on a baking sheet cut-side-up.  Brush the cut sides of the artichokes evenly with the olive oil.  Then fill the cavities evenly with the garlic, followed by a few small sprigs of the fresh herbs.  Season with salt and pepper.\n5.Flip the artichokes over, using the herbs to help hold in the garlic, so that they are cut-side-down.  Brush the tops of the artichokes with oil, and season with salt and pepper.\n6.Bake uncovered for 15 minutes.  Then remove and cover the pan with aluminum foil, and bake for an additional 25-35 minutes, or until the artichokes are tender and the leaves pull off easily.\n7. Place the tray on a cooling rack.  Carefully remove, discard the herbs (or stir them into your dipping sauce for extra flavor), and drizzle the artichokes with extra lemon juice.\n8.Serve the roasted artichokes warm with your desired dipping sauce.\n",
